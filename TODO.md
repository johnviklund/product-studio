# Product Studio TODO

This is the human's workflow-managed intake scratchpad, not a roadmap. Use `workflow todo`
to capture, shape, merge, update, or archive future work; `ROADMAP.md` owns the initial
delivery phases.

## Active Initiatives

## Small UI Changes

- **Replace the free-text tags box with a token/chip picker (capture panel + editor).**
  Tags are currently entered as a comma-separated text field (`parseTags` in
  `components/kanban/capture-panel.tsx`, `tagsFromInput` in `components/kanban/detail-panel.tsx`'s
  capture mode) that splits on commas but does not dedupe. The server rejects case-insensitive
  duplicate tags (`tagsSchema` in `src/domain/work-item.ts`), and that rejection surfaces only as
  a generic `400 "Invalid request"` (review P3 #1, 2026-07-21) with no hint that tags are the
  cause. Move to an explicit token/chip input (ideally suggesting existing tags) that dedupes
  case-insensitively on the client and shows a clear inline message — removing the last spot
  where free text is parsed into structure. Small and isolated; not urgent. *Pointer updated
  2026-07-21 (ROADMAP 1.5): `capture-editor.tsx` was deleted and its capture-mode field folded
  into `detail-panel.tsx`; this item was deliberately not folded into 1.5 (spec scoped the chip
  picker out) — the free-text behavior was preserved as-is.*
